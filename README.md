# linkx-integration

A command-line implementation of the board game **Linkx**, played in the terminal.

## Getting started

You need Node v26 (see `.nvmrc`) and pnpm 12. Or open the repository in the devcontainer, which ships with both.

```bash
make install
make run
```

Without make, use pnpm directly:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run --filter @linkx-integration/cli run
```

To add a dependency to the CLI (`-D` for a dev dependency):

```bash
pnpm add --filter @linkx-integration/cli picocolors
```

pnpm records the version in the `catalog` of `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and writes `catalog:` in the package's `package.json`.

| Command           | Runs                          | Purpose                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `make install`    | `pnpm install`                | install dependencies                    |
| `make run`        | `node src/main.ts` in the CLI | start the game                          |
| `make test`       | `vitest run`                  | run the whole test suite once           |
| `make test-watch` | `vitest`                      | run tests in watch mode                 |
| `make lint`       | `oxlint --fix` then `oxfmt`   | fix lint and formatting across the repo |

A husky pre-commit hook runs `make lint-staged`, which lints and formats only the staged files.

## Stack

- TypeScript, run directly by Node: no build step.
- pnpm workspace: each package lives in `packages/`.
- Vitest for tests, oxlint (type-aware) for linting, oxfmt for formatting.
- Dependency versions are pinned once in the `catalog` of `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; packages reference them as `catalog:`. pnpm refuses releases younger than three days.

## Project layout

```text
packages/cli/src/     game source, entry point is main.ts
packages/cli/test/    shared Vitest setup
.devcontainer/        development container
```

## Tests

Tests live next to their module as `*.spec.ts`. Vitest globals (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`) are available without import, and mocks are restored after each test.

Before pushing:

```bash
make lint
make test
```
